Dear Partner,

<p>
We are currently making changes to the infrastructure that powers attribution reporting in Google Analytics App + Web properties. This new infrastructure will support more robust attribution features and services including more diversified data sources, models and identity methods.

<p>
Currently the <a>attribution window</a> for all re-engagement conversions (all conversions except first open) in App + Web properties is set to 180 days. As part of the infrastructure migration, starting <b> June 29th</b>, we will be changing this attribution window for all re-engagement conversions from <b> 180 days to 90 days</b>. This change is automatic and requires no action on your part. Changing the attribution window from 180 days to 90 days in App + Web properties will create consistency with the maximum attribution window in Google Ads.   

<p>
This change could result in more conversions being attributed to a “direct” source in reporting for some advertisers but we expect the impact to be minimal for most. We hope that these improvements to attribution and consistency across Google products means you will get the best use of your App + Web property and Google Ads integration via better campaign performance analysis and improved optimization.

<p>
Thanks,<br />
The Google Team
