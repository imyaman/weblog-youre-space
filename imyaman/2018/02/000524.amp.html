  <p>
Dear Developer,
</p>
<p>
Since 2012, we have enabled extension developers to provide a smooth
installation experience on their own pages with <a href="https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AIR_RmGTWRy6k7c4OY13UNS25fBFcAq2tGGBNxz5jFRzmTAnJoEWWEBRy0Bz1s4X419-l3pobwLqW1T9GaX9wyMzxJ-elv7SphoSzie8EjAlksWSpixzxVhtnaGQgA">inline
installation</a>. We have also worked hard to prevent abuse of this feature by
disabling inline installation in the case of deceptive or confusing installation
flows. Today, we&#39;re announcing an update to these abuse protections.
</p>
<p>
In August 2015, we <a href="https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AIR_RmG0KIZt722XGCAYLqkMbml_Zk5N780E6lj3eQKxD1Bw1Mn4xp_0wfqrMydQZkUeycHnjzO4O9BFW25cMohJQJ33khm1zQLSGLBHk2QEUptn3yvgZduvh6sTbztonVpNmDJFnZehRScOUvj5TJ2t">announced</a>
an enforcement scheme for extensions that are distributed by deceptive or
confusing ads and inline installation pages. In a few weeks, we will upgrade our
automated inline installation abuse detection to improve our detection speed and
better detect extensions using deceptive or confusing installation flows. We are
also expanding enforcement to cover any association with deceptive practices,
including deceptive ads and landing pages, or installation patterns that suggest
user confusion.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the existing extension-level protection, our expanded enforcement
will also use machine learning to evaluate each inline installation request for
signals of deceptive, confusing, or malicious ads or webpages. When we find
those signals, we&#39;ll selectively disable that one inline installation request
and redirect the user to the extension&#39;s page on the Chrome Web Store. This
selective enforcement will not impact inline installation of that extension from
other, non-deceptive sources. Developers will not be notified of this
enforcement, as it happens on an as-needed basis.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about enforcement of inline installation policies in our <a href="https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AIR_RmHLAKgkGA7O1zFUQw84Nv7jpAt8pKtV7Vj3MQDKKiFllVlDYhEsDN7D3YRYV96fQbSyldwjNGUWDUvHtq-mGWUJruOBgDWy7rdG-90tx9MgK7W9GIPZMwWVZVBaAwA">Enforcement
FAQ</a>, including how inline pages are re-enabled after being disabled by our
automated enforcement system.
</p>
<p>
If your extension does not use inline installation, you will not be impacted by
these enforcement changes. Developers of extensions with inline installation
disabled for all extension inline installation requests will receive an email
alert from the Web Store with more information.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
The Chrome Web Store Team
